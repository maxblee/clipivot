//! This is a *very* basic library for testing command-line
//! applications in Rust. It's an experimental library, so I don't have any
//! intentions to port it over to [crates.io](https://www.crates.io) any time soon.
//!
//! The idea is that I'll gradually expand this library as I need to. It started
//! simply as a way of getting the name of a program for running integration tests
//! on a command-line tool I created to build pivot tables.
