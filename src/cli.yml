      help: "The function you use to run across the pivot table.
      \nThe functions fit into three main categories: numeric, textual, and type independent.
      \n- Numeric functions parse records as numbers, raising an error if it can't identify a number.
      \n\t- `mean` computes a mean across the matching records
      \n\t- `median` computes the median of the matching records
      \n\t- `stddev` computes the sample standard deviation of the matching records
      \n\t- `sum` sums the values
      \n- Textual functions parse everything as text
      \n\t-`count` counts all of the individual records; it operates independently from the values
      \n\t-`countunique` counts all of the unique records.
      \n\t-`mode` determines the mode (the most commonly appearing value), in insertion order in the case of a tie
      \n- Type independent functions have a default parsing method that can be overridden with the `-i` or `-N` flags
      \n\t-`max` computes the maximum value. Defaults to strings (mainly for YYYYMMDD HHMMSS date formats)
      \n\t-`min` works identically to `max` but for computing the minimum value (or oldest date)
      \n\t-`range` computes the difference between `min` and `max`. Only works for valid numeric and date formats.
